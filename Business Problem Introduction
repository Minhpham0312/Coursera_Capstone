Introduction/Business Problem
I would like to open a small fusion Asian restaurant in New York. The capital for this project is $100,000. 
In order to have a successfull business, I would like to know more about different New Yor's neiborhoods to find out where would be best for opening a new style Asian restaurant. 
Requirements for qualified neighborhood are:
  Still lack of Asian restaurants
  Lower crime rates
  Good business traffic (include both office and home customers)
